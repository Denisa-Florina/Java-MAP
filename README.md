# 💡 Concepts and Techniques Used
Both of these Java applications leverage modern design patterns and Java features to ensure modularity, efficiency, and a smooth user experience.

## 🌟 Design Patterns
**Observer/Observable Pattern:** Used in both applications to enable real-time updates. The Observer pattern allows components to be notified and updated when certain events (like user actions or changes in data) occur, enhancing interactivity and responsiveness in the user interface.

**Backtracking Algorithm:** 🛤️ Used in the Train Routes Finder application to find all possible routes efficiently, including those requiring multiple stops. This approach ensures that the app can handle complex route-finding scenarios while remaining responsive.

## 💻 Modern Java Features
**Streams API & Lambda Expressions:** Simplifies and streamlines the code, allowing for more concise and readable operations on collections and data. Lambda expressions enhance functional programming capabilities within Java, while the Streams API provides a powerful way to process sequences of elements.

## 🔢 Optional:
This feature helps to eliminate potential null pointer exceptions by providing a more explicit and safe way to handle potentially missing values in Java.

## 🐘 Database & Architecture
**PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database used in both applications to store data securely and ensure efficient data management.

**Layered Architecture (UI, Service, Repository):** Both applications use a layered architecture for modularity, making the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and test. The UI layer handles user interaction, the Service layer manages business logic, and the Repository layer handles data persistence.

## 🔔 Real-time Interaction
**Observer/Observable Pattern:** In both applications, this pattern enables real-time notifications and updates, improving interactivity and responsiveness.

## 📄 Pagination
**Pagination:** Implemented in the Social Network Application to manage large datasets efficiently, improving performance by loading only small portions of data at a time, ensuring smooth data navigation.
